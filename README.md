A small project for creating my personal portfolio. Made using React.js and Firebase for deploying and database.
=======
# Personal Portfolio Website

This project was created to serve as a personal portfolio, which can be found at dariaradu.com. It was created using [react-static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static) for the front-end, and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)  for hosting and database. As I am not a front-end developer, this project is more for me to play a bit with React code.
